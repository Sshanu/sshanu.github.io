      <p align="justify"> <i id="assemblies19_abs">Contemporary sensorimotor learning approaches typically start with an existing complex agent (e.g., a robotic arm), which they learn to control. In contrast, this paper investigates a modular co-evolution strategy: a collection of primitive agents learns to dynamically self-assemble into composite bodies while also learning to coordinate their behavior to control these bodies. Each primitive agent consists of a limb with a motor attached at one end. Limbs may choose to link up to form collectives. When a limb initiates a link-up action and there is another limb nearby, the latter is magnetically connected to the 'parent' limb's motor. This forms a new single agent, which may further link with other agents. In this way, complex morphologies can emerge, controlled by a policy whose architecture is in explicit correspondence with the morphology. We evaluate the performance of these <em>dynamic</em> and <em>modular</em> agents in simulated environments. We demonstrate better generalization to test-time changes both in the environment, as well as in the agent morphology, compared to static and monolithic baselines.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="jmlr16_abs">A major barrier towards scaling visual recognition systems is the difficulty of obtaining labeled images for large numbers of categories. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained used 1.2M+ labeled images have emerged as clear winners on object classification benchmarks. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of those labels are available with bounding box localization for training the detection task and even fewer pixel level annotations are available for semantic segmentation. It is much cheaper and easier to collect large quantities of image-level labels from search engines than it is to collect scene-centric images with precisely localized labels. We develop methods for learning large scale recognition models which exploit joint training over both weak (image-level) and strong (bounding box) labels and which transfer learned perceptual representations from strongly-labeled auxiliary tasks. We provide a novel formulation of a joint multiple instance learning method that includes examples from object-centric data with image-level labels when available, and also performs domain transfer learning to improve the underlying detector representation. We then show how to use our large scale detectors to produce pixel level annotations. Using our method, we produce a >7.6K category detector and release code and models at <a href="http://lsda.berkeleyvision.org/">lsda.berkeleyvision.org</a>.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="iccv15_abs">We present an approach to learn a dense pixel-wise labeling from image-level tags. Each image-level tag imposes constraints on the output labeling of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier. We propose Constrained CNN (CCNN), a method which uses a novel loss function to optimize for any set of linear constraints on the output space (i.e. predicted label distribution) of a CNN. Our loss formulation is easy to optimize and can be incorporated directly into standard stochastic gradient descent optimization. The key idea is to phrase the training objective as a biconvex optimization for linear models, which we then relax to nonlinear deep networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generality of our new learning framework. The constrained loss yields state-of-the-art results on weakly supervised semantic image segmentation. We further demonstrate that adding slightly more supervision can greatly improve the performance of the learning algorithm.</i></p>

Previous methods for weak-label learning often learn detector models independently using latent variable optimization, but fail to share deep representation knowledge across classes and usually require strong initialization. Other previous methods transfer deep representations from domains with strong labels to those with only weak labels, but do not optimize over individual latent boxes, and thus may miss specific salient structures for a particular category.  We propose a model that subsumes these previous approaches, and simultaneously trains a representation and detectors for categories with either weak or strong labels present. We provide a novel formulation of a joint multiple instance learning method that includes examples from classification-style data when available, and also performs domain transfer learning to improve the underlying detector representation. Our model outperforms known methods on ImageNet-200 detection with weak labels.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="iclr15_abs">Multiple instance learning (MIL) can reduce the need for costly annotation in tasks such as semantic segmentation by weakening the required degree of supervision. We propose a novel MIL formulation of multi-class semantic segmentation learning by a fully convolutional network. In this setting, we seek to learn a semantic segmentation model from just weak image-level labels. The model is trained end-to-end to jointly optimize the representation while disambiguating the pixel-image label assignment. Fully convolutional training accepts inputs of any size, does not need object proposal pre-processing, and offers a pixelwise loss map for selecting latent instances. Our multi-class MIL loss exploits the further supervision given by images with multiple labels. We evaluate this approach through preliminary experiments on the PASCAL VOC segmentation challenge.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="wacv15_abs">Topic-models for video analysis have been used for unsupervised identification of normal activity in videos, thereby enabling the detection of anomalous actions. However, while intervals containing anomalies are detected, it has not been possible to localize the anomalous activities in such models. This is a challenging problem as the abnormal content is usually a small fraction of the entire video data and hence distinctions in terms of likelihood are unlikely. Here we propose a methodology to extend the topic based analysis with rich local descriptors incorporating quantized spatio-temporal gradient descriptors with image location and size information. The visual clips over this vocabulary are then represented in latent topic space using models like pLSA. Further, we introduce an algorithm to quantify the anomalous content in a video clip by projecting the learned topic space information. Using the algorithm, we detect whether the video clip is abnormal and if positive, localize the anomaly in spatio-temporal domain. We also contribute one real world surveillance video dataset for comprehensive evaluation of the proposed algorithm. Experiments are presented on the proposed and two other standard surveillance datasets.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="fg15_abs">One of the interesting applications of computer vision is to be able to identify or detect persons in real world. This problem has been posed in the context of identifying people in television series or in multi-camera networks. However, a common scenario for this problem is to be able to identify people among images prevalent on social networks. In this paper we present a method that aims to solve this problem in real world conditions where the person can be in any pose, profile and orientation and the face itself is not always clearly visible. Moreover, we show that the problem can be solved with as weak supervision only a label whether the person is present or not, which is usually the case as people are tagged in social networks. This is challenging as there can be ambiguity in association of the right person. The problem is solved in this setting using a latent max-margin formulation where the identity of the person is the latent parameter that is classified. This framework builds on other off the shelf computer vision techniques for person detection and face detection and is able to also account for inaccuracies of these components. The idea is to model the complete person in addition to face, that too with weak supervision. We also contribute three real-world datasets that we have created for extensive evaluation of the solution. We show using these datasets that the problem can be effectively solved using the proposed method.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="jpm15_abs">We compare Oscar forecasts derived from four data types (fundamentals, polling, prediction markets, and domain experts) across three attributes (accuracy, timeliness and cost effectiveness). Fundamentals-based forecasts are relatively expensive to construct, an attribute the academic literature frequently ignores, and update slowly over time, constraining their accuracy. However, fundamentals provide valuable insights into the relationship between key indicators for nominated movies and their chances of victory. For instance, we find that the performance in other awards shows is highly predictive of the Oscar victory whereas box office results are not. Polling- based forecasts have the potential to be both accurate and timely. Timeliness requires incentives for frequent responses by high-information users. Accuracy is achieved by a proper transformation of raw polls. Prediction market prices are accurate forecasts, but can be further improved by simple transformations of raw prices, yielding the most accurate forecasts in our study. Expert forecasts exhibit some characteristics of fundamental models, but are generally not comparatively accurate or timely. This study is unique in both comparing and aggregating four traditional data sources, and considering critical attributes beyond accuracy. We believe that the results of this study generalize to many other domains.</i></p>

      <p align="justify"> <i id="iclr16_abs">Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as the dominant model in computer vision. If provided with enough training data, they predict almost any visual quantity. In a discrete setting, such as classification, CNNs are not only able to predict a label but often predict a confidence in the form of a probability distribution over the output space. In continuous regression tasks, such a probability estimate is often lacking. We present a regression framework which models the output distribution of neural networks. This output distribution allows us to infer the most likely labeling following a set of physical or modeling constraints. These constraints capture the intricate interplay between different input and output variables, and complement the output of a CNN. However, they may not hold everywhere. Our setup further allows to learn a confidence with which a constraint holds, in the form of a distribution of the constrain satisfaction. We evaluate our approach on the problem of intrinsic image decomposition, and show that constrained structured regression significantly increases the state-of-the-art.</i></p>
